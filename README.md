# Data-Storytelling

## Project Requirements
You are free to use libraries introduced in the class (i.e., Altair, Panel, Streamlit, and D3.js) or any code-based libraries (e.g., Bokeh, Plotly, Holoviz, GeoViews, PyVis). However, you are not allowed to use dashboard software (e.g., Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, QlikSense) for the final project.

The requirements of your project are the following:

At least 3 different views/visualization components (e.g., 3 bar charts only count as 1 component)
Multiple views coordinated with linked highlighting. A click/hover/selection interaction within one view must trigger a change in a different view. At least 2 views need to be linked. Ideally, these views are linked bidirectionally.
At least 2 UI widgets allow users to filter the data or update certain views interactively (e.g., dropdown, radio button, range slider, calendar).
Interactive tooltips are shown when users hover over marks, at least in one view.
You do not necessarily build backends; only an index.html file should be enough. Your interface should be as self-explaining as possible, with appropriate labels for panels, axes, and widgets, a legend documenting the meaning of visual encodings, and a meaningful title and description.
